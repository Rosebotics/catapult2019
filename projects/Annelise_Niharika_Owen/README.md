# EEL
### Niharika Annelise, and Owen
Our game is an action spin-off of the classic game "Snake". Instead of the classic snake, 
we chose an eel in an ocean theme to highlight the deplorable state of our oceans due to 
plastic pollution. The objective of the game is for the eel to eat as many fish as possible
while avoiding plastic water bottles, the wall, and the body of the eel character. As the eel 
eats more fish, it grows longer which corresponds to an increasing score.
